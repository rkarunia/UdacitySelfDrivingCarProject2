    "#### 1. Basic summary of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the second code cell of the IPython notebook.  \n",
    "I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of training examples = 34799\n",
    "* Number of validation examples = 4410\n",

    "The preprocessing step includes converting from RGB to grayscale and normalize the image data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to convert the images to grayscale because color is not a decisive factor for recognizing a traffic sign. A speed limit sign should be recognizable either in grayscale or color.\n",
    "In addition, using only 1 channel of the image data reduce the data size by 70 % and speed up the training process.  \n",
